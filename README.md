# Credit-Card-Fraud
A machine learning project using Python to detect Credit Card Fraud using Decision Trees and Random Forest

## Context
This is a binary classification machine learning project that trains models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that users are not charged for purchases they did not make and their funds are protected.

## Data
The dataset comes from a Kaggle dataset that contains credit card transactions over the course of two days. There are 492 instances of fraud out of 284,807 transactions. PCA was done on the dataset by its creators on a majority of the features, resulting in principal components such as V1, V2, ... V28. Other features include 'Time' which represents the seconds between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The 'Amount' feature holds the transaction amount. The 'Class' feature is the response variable where 1 represents fraud and 0 represents non-fraudulent activity.
